### **Assignment 2 - Numpy Array Operations** 

This assignment is part of the course ["Data Analysis with Python: Zero to Pandas"](http://zerotopandas.com). The objective of this assignment is to develop a solid understanding of Numpy array operations. In this assignment I have disscussed about 5 numpy functions. 

Those are: 

 - np.atleast_2d()
 
 - np.concatenate()
 
 - numpy.ndarray.T
 
 - np.left_shift()
 
 - np.sort()
